I switched to using `_.throttle`, which has `trailing: true` by default. Error message:\nhttps://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/58d428743111af1d0a20cf28/59cbeb80295a82a03226fca5/89f83cf5e7d2392b793279b93fba1f31/capture.png\n\nThe issue was that the throttled function calls `d3.mouse()`, which depends on the value of `d3.event` internally.\nd3 was clearing that value after the event had fired. So it was gone by the time we hit the trailing call.\n\nThe fix: update the throttle code to record the value of `d3.event` and set it just before calling the function each time.\nhttps://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/58d428743111af1d0a20cf28/59cbec239d4a68c1cbc981e1/25a207c92459b0a327e6a624d1f33bca/capture.png\n\nThe error: https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/58d428743111af1d0a20cf28/59cbec593206a0ef014a1d0f/af6d3293fc434f38ca4946252ea78084/capture.png\n\nd3.event is a getter, and cannot be set.

The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the\n * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction d3Debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      lastD3Event,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError('Expected a function');\n  }\n  wait = _.toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (_.isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?
